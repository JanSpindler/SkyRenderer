		paper is application to space flight simulators (e.g., reentry to the atmosphere) and the simulation of surveys of
		the earth (comparisons with observations from weather satellites and weather simulations); it is not for geometric
		modeling of terrains and/or clouds viewed from the ground, but for displaying the earth including the surface of
		the sea viewed from outer space taking into account particles (air molecules and aerosols) in the atmosphere and
		water molecules in the sea. The major points of the algorithm proposed here are the efficient calculation of
		optical length and sky light, with lookup tables taking advantage of the facts that the earth is spherical, and
		that sunlight is parallel.",
